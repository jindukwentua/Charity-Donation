# Charity-Donation
You have been hired to deliver actionable insight to support a client who is a national charitable organisation. The client seeks to use the results of a previous postcard mail solicitation for donations to improve outcome in the next campaign. You want to determine which of the individuals in their mailing database have characteristics similar to those of your most profitable donors. By soliciting only these people, your client can spend less money on the solicitation effort and more money on charitable concerns.
